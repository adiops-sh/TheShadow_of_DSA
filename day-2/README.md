# ðŸ“… Day 2 â€“ Array Logical Basics (30 Questions)

Welcome to **Day 2** of my DSA journey with Java â€” part of the `TheShadow_of_DSA` series.

This file contains solutions to 30 beginner-friendly logical questions based on arrays in Java.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Sample Questions

Here are a few examples from the set:

- Q1: Read the first and last element of the array  
- Q5: Print array in reverse order  
- Q9: Count even and odd numbers  
- Q14: Find maximum and minimum in one pass  
- Q20: Check if the array is sorted  
- Q30: Find sum and average of array elements

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- Indexing is ðŸ”‘ in arrays (starting from 0)
- How to avoid out-of-bounds errors
- Writing clean and structured loops
- Using `arr.length` dynamically
- The power of `for-each` vs traditional `for`

## ðŸ’¡ Interesting Array Facts (Java)

- Arrays are objects in Java  
- Arrays store references for non-primitives  
- Access time is O(1) â€” very fast  
- Arrays can be jagged (2D with different row lengths)  
- Default values: `int` â†’ 0, `boolean` â†’ false, `String` â†’ null  
- `arr[arr.length]` causes `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`

## ðŸ“Œ NOTE:

Arrays are the backbone of logic-building in programming.

They offer:
-  **Constant time access** using index (O(1))
-  **Contiguous memory allocation** â€” faster cache access
-  **Foundation for advanced structures** like stacks, queues, and matrices
-  Fixed size: Once declared, their size cannot be changed â€” making them both **efficient** and **memory-predictable**
-  Arrays help sharpen thinking about loops, memory, and data flow â€” essential for mastering DSA and cracking coding interviews

**Mastering arrays = mastering the mindset of a developer.**
