# 📅 Day 1 – Linear Search & Binary Search Algorithms

Welcome to **Day 1** of my DSA journey with Java — part of the `TheShadow_of_DSA` series.
In this module, we explore two fundamental searching techniques — **Linear Search** and **Binary Search** — implemented in Java.

## 📘 What is Searching?

Searching means finding the **position of a value** (called target) in a list (array).  
Example:  
If you have: `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`  
And you want to find `30`, you use a **search algorithm**.

## 🔄 Two Main Ways to Search:

### 1️⃣ Linear Search  
Check every element **one by one** from start to end.  
 Works on **unsorted** and **sorted** arrays.  
 Slower for large datasets.

### 2️⃣ Binary Search  
Keep **dividing the array in half** and search in the correct half.  
 Works only on **sorted** arrays.  
 Faster than Linear Search (especially for large data).
