# TheShadow_of_DSA
> Sharpening My Java DSA Skills — For Interviews, Hackathons & Real-World Engineering | CDAC Sunbeam Backed

Welcome to **TheShadow_of_DSA** — my personal journey to master Data Structures and Algorithms in Java, guided by **CDAC Sunbeam Infotech, Pune**.  
This repository reflects my daily commitment to mastering DSA — **one concept at a time, multiple problems per day** — in public, with purpose and consistency.

## 📌 What is this repo about?

- A daily log of DSA concepts, implementations, and problems  
- Written in **Java** — focused on clarity, edge cases & optimization  
- Public commits for consistency, accountability, and growth

## 🎯 Why I’m building this repo

I want to make this a **one-stop solution for anyone serious about DSA in Java** — something I couldn’t easily find elsewhere.  
I’m gradually collecting the best content, different problem types, and practical solutions to help not just myself, but others too.

> **The more questions you solve, the sharper your skills become.**  
That’s the only strategy here.

## 📊 What Makes This Repo Different?

- Not just random questions — everything here is **curated, understood, and solved.**
- Problems picked from **multiple platforms and YouTube educators**, but structured and simplified here.
- **Java-first** code, written for clarity and real-world understanding.
- My personal roadmap to DSA mastery — publicly available for anyone to follow.

> **This repo is what I wish I had when I started.**
